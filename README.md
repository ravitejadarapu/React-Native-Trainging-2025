# React Native Training 2025 Developer Challenge: Application Development Problem Statements

Trainees who have gone through React Native Training from external vendor during 21-April-2025 to 30-April-2025. Please go through below problem statements and pick one to submit your solution. Please create a branch within this repository with your name and provide your developed solution here. 

[!Note]
For any Backend APIs please use any open source apis available or it is fine to use static jsons. Developing backend apis for the problem statements is not required.

## Implementation Hints

### Architecture
- Consider using Redux or Context API for state management
- Implement a clean folder structure separating components, services, and utilities
- Use React Navigation for routing between screens

### UI Components
- Utilize React Native Paper or Native Base for consistent UI components
- Consider React Native Elements for pre-built components
- For complex animations, look into React Native Reanimated

### Data Storage & API
- Use AsyncStorage for simple persistent storage
- Consider Realm or SQLite for more complex local storage needs
- Firebase or AWS Amplify can provide backend services if needed, or use static jsons.
